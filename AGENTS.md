# Peer Local

Peer is a workspace for coding agents, based on T3 Code. A Node WebSocket server runs provider CLIs and agents (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, Antigravity) and serves web, desktop, and mobile clients.

This repository is `SemanS/peer-app`, on the `peer` branch. Peer Local works without a Hub account. The private Hub service is not an app build input. Keep upstream licenses, credit and runtime identifiers intact.

## Product constraints

Preserve these constraints across changes.

### 1. Keep Local independent

Clients, the local engine, hooks and public contracts stay distributable under their licenses. Users can run and fork Local without private Hub source. Commercial team policy and admission stay in the Hub.

### 2. Check performance

Watch for oversized WebSocket payloads, continuously repainting CSS animations and expensive lists. Check the affected path for regressions when changing it.

### 3. Support remote connections

Support local network connections, Tailscale and the inherited T3 Connect tunnel integration where the feature applies. A feature that works on localhost can still fail remotely.

### 4. Check each client

Peer has web, desktop and mobile clients.

**Web** connects through a locally hosted app or a hosted client. Upstream's hosted client is `app.t3.codes`. Check both connection paths when the feature applies.

**Desktop** is an Electron app that bundles the server runner. It can also host remote web and mobile connections.

**Mobile** is a React Native client for iOS and Android. It connects to a running environment to control work remotely. The upstream app-store listings distribute T3 Code.

## Implementation approach

Find the constraint before choosing an implementation. Prefer the smallest model that handles it correctly. Keep existing complexity only when it serves a current requirement.

Check assumptions, keep the requested scope and avoid adding systems for hypothetical needs.

The developer's explicit instructions take precedence over these defaults.

Contributors may run agents from the app they are changing, including over remote connections. Take care with runtime data and processes.

## A small glossary

We need to be on the same page with terminology. When communicating, use this language:

- **you** means the agent reading this file and changing Peer.
- **we, us, and maintainers** mean the people maintaining this Peer fork. Upstream means T3 Code's maintainers.
- **user** means the person using Peer to direct coding agents.
- **agent** means a coding agent a user runs in Peer. Depending on context, that may include you.
- **provider** means the agent runtime or harness Peer talks to, such as Codex, Claude, Cursor, or OpenCode.
- **client** means the web, desktop, or mobile UI.
- **environment** means one running T3 server and the machine, filesystem, provider credentials, and state it owns.
- **project** means an environment-local workspace record rooted at a directory.
- **thread** means the durable conversation and work history for a project.
- **turn** means one user-to-agent cycle, including follow-up work such as checkpointing.
- **T3 home** means the base data directory. Runtime state normally lives below its userdata directory.

## The three ways to hurt yourself

1. **Killing by pattern.** Never `pkill -f`, `pgrep | kill`, or `kill` a PID you found by matching a name, path, or worktree string. Your own agent process has this worktree's path in its argv, and this machine runs several other dev servers at once. Kill only a PID you captured at spawn, or the owner of your port from `ss -H -ltnp` after confirming `/proc/<pid>/cwd` is your worktree.
2. **Writing to the live install.** `~/.t3/userdata` is the developer's real T3 Code database, in use while you work. Reading it and copying from it are fine, and a good way to get real test data (see Test data). Never start a server against it, never open it read-write, never clean it up.
3. **Baking in origins.** Never set `VITE_HTTP_URL` or `VITE_WS_URL` for dev. Dev is single-origin and Vite proxies `/api`, `/ws`, `/oauth`, and `/.well-known`. Setting them bakes localhost into the bundle and silently breaks every remote browser.

## Hit every surface

The most common defect in this repo is a change that works on the path you tested and is missing everywhere else. Before calling frontend work done, walk this list and say which entries applied:

- **Entry points.** A behavior reachable from the chat view is usually also reachable from Settings, the command palette, and a keybinding. Fixing one is not fixing the feature.
- **Clients.** Web, desktop (wraps web, adds Electron shell/IPC), and mobile (React Native, separate navigation). Shared logic lives in `packages/client-runtime`
- **Providers.** Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, and Antigravity each have an adapter. Provider-shaped features need a decision per adapter, even if the decision is "not supported here".
- **Agents.** A capability a user can trigger is usually one an agent should reach through MCP tools, and scheduled tasks run the same paths. That only works when it is a service method, not handler code.
- **Contracts.** Anything crossing the wire is typed in `packages/contracts`. Change the schema and the server, web, mobile, and desktop all follow.
- **Reverse states.** If you added a way in, add the way out and the way to see it. Snooze needs unsnooze. Close needs reopen. A one-way door is a bug.
- **Connection modes.** Local, remote/relay, and tunnel behave differently. Multi-device and multi-environment cases are real.
- **Docs.** Check whether the change makes existing guidance inaccurate. Apply the [documentation rules](#documentation) before adding anything.

## Dev servers

- `vp i` installs. Worktrees get this from the t3.json setup script; if module resolution looks broken, it probably did not run.
- `vp run dev` starts server and web. In a worktree, state defaults to that worktree's gitignored `.t3`, which deliberately outranks an ambient `T3CODE_HOME` so you cannot land on shared state by accident. An explicit `--home-dir` still wins.
- Ports derive from the worktree path and are stable across restarts, but read the real ones from the `[dev-runner]` line since occupied ports shift.
- Sharing over the tailnet is three steps: run `vp run dev --share` in the background, wait for the `pairingUrl:` line in its output, then give that full URL to an unpaired browser. Do not wire up `tailscale serve` by hand, open the URL yourself, or consume the user's pairing link. A browser with the reusable dev cookie can use the bare origin. If a normal one-time token was consumed, mint a fresh one with `node apps/server/src/bin.ts pair`. It carries standard scopes, while the startup URL carries admin scopes needed for Connections settings.
- To reuse web dev auth across worktrees, configure one fixed `T3CODE_DEV_AUTH_TOKEN` in the main checkout's gitignored `.env`. The `t3.json` setup links that file into worktrees. Never commit or publish the token or a startup URL. See [Reusable dev credential](docs/operations/development.md#reusable-dev-credential).
- Stop what you started, by the PID you tracked. See rule 1.

## Test data

An empty database is a bad test. Seed your worktree's `.t3` with a copy of real data instead of pointing at live state:

- Run `vp run migrate-dev-db` with your dev server stopped. It rebuilds `<worktree>/.t3/userdata/statev2.sqlite` from a read-only snapshot of `~/.t3/userdata/statev2.sqlite`, the developer's real data. It keeps recent projects and their stopped threads, and drops scheduled tasks, pending work, and auth sessions, so your dev server never runs the developer's agents. Raise `--projects` and `--threads-per-project` for more data.
- Refresh `statev2.sqlite`, not `state.sqlite`. The server copies the V1 `state.sqlite` only when `statev2.sqlite` is missing.
- Bring `secrets` and `settings.json` only if the flow under test needs them.
- Copy in, never symlink. Data flows one way: into your sandbox, never back out.

## Verifying

- Smallest proof that the change works. `vp test run <files>` for the tests you touched, targeted lint and typecheck for the scope you changed.
- Test meaningful logic or observable behavior. Do not render components to static markup to assert props or attributes, or add tests that merely assert callback wiring or mirror the implementation.
- **Do not run repo-wide checks.** No `vp check`, no `vp run -r test`, no `vp run -r typecheck` unless I ask. There is no CI: a maintainer runs the full suite before a release.
- Backend behavior changes ship with focused tests for that behavior.
- The server is event-sourced, and side effects run after the command commits. In tests, drain the effect worker (`OrchestrationEffectWorkerV2.drain`) or await the specific persisted event or `Deferred` that marks the milestone. Never wait on sleeps or polling. A test that needs a timeout to pass is wrong.
- Upon request, user-visible frontend changes should get one integrated pass in a real client: `test-t3-app` for web, `test-t3-mobile` for mobile. The primary agent does this once after integrating. Subagents do not launch their own dev servers. Ask permission before doing computer use or spinning up browsers.

For authorized mobile verification, a missing or outdated native client is a build step, not a blocker. Run `node scripts/mobile-native-client.ts ensure <ios|android> <device-id>` on the simulator host before starting Metro. It checks the local Expo fingerprint and builds/installs when needed. See `test-t3-mobile` for the full workflow.

## macOS updates: preserve signing identity and Full Disk Access

When updating an existing Peer installation, preserve its certificate-backed designated requirement.
An ad-hoc signature ties privacy permissions to a changing binary hash and breaks Full Disk Access.

- Read the operator's existing signing configuration before building. Local maintainer profiles
  default to `~/.config/peer/mac-signing.identity` (certificate SHA-1 fingerprint) and
  `~/.config/peer/mac-signing.identity.requirement` (original designated requirement). Respect the
  operator's configured paths. If either is missing, recover the established configuration before
  updating; never derive a replacement baseline from the new candidate merely to pass verification.
- For the local certificate workflow, `scripts/build-desktop-artifact.ts` requires
  `T3CODE_DESKTOP_MAC_LOCAL_IDENTITY` set to the pinned fingerprint and `T3CODE_DESKTOP_SIGNED=false`.
  Set `T3CODE_DESKTOP_MAC_LOCAL_SIGNING_TYPE` to `development` for Apple Development or
  `distribution` for Developer ID Application, matching the established identity. Confirm that
  identity is available in Keychain. Unsigned/ad-hoc artifacts are not replacements for an
  installed certificate-signed app. Local Development signing does not provide public notarization.
- Sign before creating every distributable. Never re-sign the result ad hoc (`codesign --sign -`),
  remove signatures, weaken requirements or bypass a signing failure. Preserve bundle ID
  `io.github.semans.peer` and all certificate attributes named in the original requirement,
  including subject common name and issuer when renewing. Keep private keys in Keychain.
- Before installing, verify the candidate's seal and original identity with
  `codesign --verify --deep --strict -R="<saved requirement>" "/path/to/staged/Peer.app"`.
  A mismatch blocks installation. Quit Peer normally, back up the existing bundle, replace it with
  the verified bundle without modification, verify `/Applications/Peer.app` again, then reopen.
  Check startup and fresh TCC logs; backend availability alone does not establish Full Disk Access.
- Ordinary updates must not require a new privacy grant. An explicitly intended identity migration
  may require one: use System Settings, remove a stale Peer record if re-adding retains the old
  requirement, add exact `/Applications/Peer.app`, enable access and use **Quit & Reopen**. Leave
  password/Touch ID entry to the user. Never edit/reset TCC storage or bypass macOS authorization.

## Pull requests

- Never make a PR unless the developer explicitly asks you to do so.
- Conventional commit titles, plain language: `fix(web): new threads no longer spike CPU`.
- Body: the problem in a sentence or two, then how you fixed it. End with the model and harness that did the work.
- UI changes need before/after images. Motion or timing needs a short video.
- Upload PR evidence to GitHub. Never commit PR-only screenshots or assets such as `.github/pr-assets/`.
- One request is one PR. Split it only when the maintainer asks. Outside contributions follow the stricter [one problem per PR](CONTRIBUTING.md#one-problem) rule.
- When babysitting: poll checks and comments newer than the last push, verify each bot finding against the source, fix real ones, dismiss false positives with a written reason. Stay quiet when nothing is new. Stop when the bots are green on the latest commit.

## Documentation

Most code changes do not need an internal documentation change. Agents can read the code.

- `docs/internals/` is for architectural decisions and their reasons, constraints that span components, and implementation traps that are hard to discover from the source. Before adding a paragraph, ask what a maintainer would get wrong without it. If reading the relevant code answers the question, leave it out.
- Do not document every feature, enumerate fields or methods, narrate control flow, maintain file catalogs, or append PR summaries. Types, tests, and code already record the implementation. The glossary defines shared vocabulary; it is not a feature index.
- Keep a local implementation explanation in a nearby code comment. Use an internal doc when the reasoning crosses boundaries or needs context the code cannot carry well. Link to the relevant source instead of copying it.
- When a documented decision or constraint changes, rewrite or remove the affected text. Do not append another account of the new behavior. A new internal page needs a distinct, durable reason to exist.
- `docs/user/` helps users accomplish tasks. Give each major feature a concise section explaining what it does, how to start, and anything unintuitive. A settings path is useful; descriptions of visible buttons, icons, layouts, animations, or every UI state are not. Before adding text, ask what task or decision it helps the user with.
- Keep user docs in the shipped product's voice, without implementation details or contributor tooling. Update the relevant feature section when how to use it changes. A UI tweak does not need a documentation entry, and a new control does not need its own page.
- `docs/operations/` holds maintainer setup, release, and debugging procedures. Keep instructions for operating an installed T3 Code server in the user guides.

## Plans and work artifacts

- Do not commit implementation plans, research notes, or agent scratch files. Keep temporary working material outside the worktree. `.plans/` is gitignored only as a safety net for legacy tooling.
- Track active maintainer work in the GitHub issue or project item that owns it. External proposals follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` and belong in Ideas discussions.
- A merged PR is the implementation record. Close or update its tracking item when the work lands; do not preserve a second checklist in the repository.

## How it works

Clients send typed WebSocket requests. The server turns them into _commands_. The _orchestrator_ (`apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/Orchestrator.ts`) serializes commands and decides _events_ without doing any I/O. The _event sink_ commits those events, the _projections_ the UI reads, the _command receipt_, and _outbox_ effects in one transaction. The _effect worker_ then runs the effects, such as starting a provider turn or capturing a checkpoint, and feeds results back as commands. Provider CLIs run as subprocesses; per-provider _adapters_ translate their native protocols into orchestration events. Each turn ends with a _checkpoint_, a hidden git ref, so the app can diff and restore.

Architecture and its constraints: `docs/internals/overview.md`. Glossary: `docs/internals/glossary.md`

## Where code lives

- `apps/server` - WebSocket, orchestration, providers, checkpointing. Effect-heavy: read [Effect services](docs/internals/effect-services.md) before adding server code, and `.repos/effect-smol/LLMS.md` for the Effect library itself.
- `apps/web` - React/Vite UI. `apps/desktop` wraps it, `apps/mobile` is React Native, `apps/marketing` is the site.
- `packages/contracts` - Effect/Schema contracts plus small derived helpers. No heavy runtime logic.
- `packages/shared` - shared runtime utils, subpath exports, no barrel.
- `packages/client-runtime` - client code shared by web and mobile.
- `apps/server/src/peerHub` - Peer: a small core plus optional plugins, mirrored in contracts, clients and the Hub. Read [Peer plugins](docs/internals/peer-plugins.md) before adding a Peer feature.
- `.repos/` - vendored read-only references. Prefer their patterns over invented ones. Never edit or import from them. Sync with `vpr sync:repos` when bumping the matching dependency.

## Taste

- Complexity belongs at the adapter boundary. Orchestration stays pure, UI stays dumb.
- Client mutations use `createEnvironmentRpcCommand`. Add protected methods to `CLIENT_GUARDED_RPC_SCOPES` in contracts and use the command's `permissionAtom` for UI availability. Grants are checked at execution against the destination environment; the server remains authoritative. Keep raw RPC clients inside `rpc/`, and extend the permission behavior tests when adding a protected method.
- Server features are services; transports stay thin. A `ws.ts` RPC handler, HTTP route, or MCP tool decodes input, calls one service method, and maps errors. See [Effect services](docs/internals/effect-services.md).
- `apps/web/src/components/ui` exports own their look. Pick a `variant` or `size`; do not restyle one with `className`. If none fits and the look is a generic concept, add a variant to the component; a look that belongs to one feature stays in that feature's own component, not in `components/ui`. Layout classes (width, flex, margin, position) belong on the parent. `shadcn/no-restyle` fails lint on violations. See [Web UI](docs/internals/web-ui.md).
- Inferred types over annotations. `any` is the enemy.
- Comments say why: a constraint, an external quirk, or an invariant the code can't show. Don't restate names or signatures, narrate steps, or record history. `t3code/no-low-value-comments` catches the mechanical cases.
- Our users drive agents all day and notice a dropped frame, a lying spinner, and a stale label. No continuously repainting animations; they peg the GPU on high-refresh displays.
- If a rule here fights the task in front of you, say so loudly and get a human sign-off before breaking it.

## Additional tips

- Don't verify with browsers or computer use unless the user explicitly agrees or requests it.
- Security is important, but should not be over-indexed on, especially for dev mode/maintainer-only features.
